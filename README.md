### Prime Factorization and Combination
This Python project provides utilities to compute the prime factorizations of two numbers and combine these factorizations by taking the maximum exponent for each prime that appears in either factorization. The result of the combination is the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers based on their prime factorizations.

### Modules
The project consists of three main Python scripts:

- main.py: The main driver script that prompts the user for two numbers, computes their prime factorizations, combines them, and then calculates the result of their combination.

- combine_factors.py: Contains a function to combine two lists of prime factors into a single list representing the combined factorization.

- prime_factorization.py: Contains a function that performs prime factorization of a given number.

### Installation
No external libraries are required to run this project. You can simply clone this repository without any further steps needed.

### Usage
To run the program, navigate to the directory containing the files and run:

py main.py

You will be prompted to enter two integers. After entering the numbers, the script will display the combined prime factors and the result of their combination, which corresponds to the least common multiple of the two numbers.
